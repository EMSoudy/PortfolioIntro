# Portfolio Introduction

Hi, I'm Esebia!

Welcome to my GitHub Portfolio! I'm a data analyst and health informatician who is eager to learn and curious by nature with experience in identifying trends and patterns through statistical analytics, in addition to data cleansing and analyzation. I've been able to showcase these skills through a diverse array of healthcare related projects.

I have a passion for sorting through the noise and uncovering the meaning of data, as well as storytelling through data analysis and data visualization. Once you're able to turn data into something meaningful, it can have the ability to do so much and help so many. This is especially true when it comes to healthcare. Health informatics has done so much to help improve healthcare in areas such as patient experience, clinical outcomes, and quality of care. 
 
I am proficient in the following languages and software: R / RStudio, Python, SQL, and Tableau, JSON, jQuery, Linux.
